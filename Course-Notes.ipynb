    "    Select Statement: \n",
    "    \n",
    "        You specify a list of columns in the table from which you want to query data in the ‘Select’ clause. You use a comma between each column in case you want to query data from multiple columns. \n",
    "        \n",
    "        If you want to query data from all columns, you can use an asterisk(*) as the shorthand from all columns. \n",
    "        \n",
    "        You should use ‘select’ statement with ‘from’ statement. Because, you should say table name for bringing columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "    ➽SELECT column_1, column_2 \n",
    "        FROM table_name;\n",
    "        \n",
    "    ➽SELECT * \n",
    "        FROM table_name; \n",
    "\n",
    "    SQL language is case insensitive. It means if you use SELECT or select the effect is the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Select with Distinct: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    İn a table, a column may contain many duplicate values and sometimes you only want to list different (distinct) values. The Distinct keyword can be used to return only distinct (different) values. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    ➽SELECT distinct column_1, column_2 \n",
    "        FROM table_name;\n",
    " \n",
    "    Where Statement:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        If you want to query just particular rows from a table, you need to use the ‘Where’ clause in the ‘Select’ statement.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    ➽SELECT column_1, column_2 \n",
    "        FROM table_name\n",
    "        WHERE conditions; \n",
    "\n",
    "    The WHERE clause appears right after the FROM clause of the SELECT statement. The conditions are used to filter the rows returned from the Select statement.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    PostgreSQL provides you with various standard operators to construct the conditions. \n",
    "    =              Equal\n",
    "    >              Greater than\n",

    "    Count:\n",
    "    The count function returns the number of input rows that match a specific condition of a query. \n",
    "    ➽ SELECT count(*)\n",
    "         FROM table_name;\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Count(*) function returns the number of rows returned by a Select clause. When you apply count(*) to the entire table, PostgreSQL scans the table sequentially. You can also specify a specific column count for readability. However, The Count(*) function doesn’t consider NULL values in the column. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    ➽ SELECT count(column)\n",
    "         FROM table_name;\n",
    "    We can use Count with Distinct. For example; \n",
    "    ➽ SELECT count(Distinct column)\n",
    "         FROM table_name;\n",
    "\n",
    "    Limit:\n",

    "         LİMİT 5; \n",
    "\n",
    "    Order by:\n",
    "    When you query data from a table, PostgreSQL returns the rows in the order that they were inserted into the table. In order to sort the result set, you use the ‘Order by’ clause in the Select statement. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The order by clause allows you to sort the rows returned from the select statement in ascending or descending order based on criteria specified. \n",
    "\n",
    "    ➽ SELECT column_1, column_2, column_3\n",
    "         FROM table_name\n",
    "         ORDER BY column_1 asc (or desc);\n",
    "\n",
    "    Specify the column that you want to sort in the Order by clause. If you sort the result set by multiple columns, use a comma to separate between two columns. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Use ‘ASC’ to sort the result set in ascending order and ‘DESC’ to sort result set in descending order. If you leave it blank, the Order by clause will use ASC by default. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Between, in, like:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    We use the ‘Between’ operator to match a value against a range of values. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    ➽ value Between low and high;  (value >= low and value <= high)\n",
    "    If we want to check if a value is out of a range, we use the ‘Not Between’ operator as follows. \n",
    "    ➽ value Not Between low and high; \n",
    "\n",
    "    You use the ‘IN’ operator with the where clause to check if a value matches any value in a list of values.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ➽ value in (value1,value2, …) \n",
    "    ➽ SELECT column_1, column_2, column_3\n",
    "         FROM table_name\n",
    "         WHERE value in (value1,value2, …);\n",
    "         \n",
    "    The expression returns true if the value matches any value in the list  i.e., value1, value2,etc. The list of value is not limited to a list of numbers or strings but also a result set of a select statement as show in the following query: \n",
    "    \n",
    "     ➽ value in (SELECT value FROM table_name)\n",
    "\n",
    "    You use the ‘Like’ operator to find a value that is similar to the written value. For example, you want to find people whose first name starts ‘jen’. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    ➽ SELECT first_name\n",
    "         FROM table_name\n",

    "         \n",
    "    The query returns rows whose values in the first name column begin with jen and may be followed by any sequence of characters. Percent (%) for matching any sequence of characters. Underscore ( _ ) for matching any single character. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## __2- Group by Statements__  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Min, Max, Avg, Sum:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Min finds a minimum value in your column. \n",

    "         FROM table_name\n",
    "         \n",
    "    Max finds a maximum value in your column. \n",

    "         FROM table_name\n",
    "         \n",
    "    Sum finds total value in your column. \n",
    "    ➽ SELECT SUM(amount)\n",
    "         FROM table_name\n",
    "         \n",
    "    Avg finds an average value in your column. \n",
    "    ➽ SELECT AVG(amount)\n",
    "         FROM table_name\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you don’t want to see a lot of numbers after the comma, you can use the ‘Round’ function. \n",
    "     ➽ SELECT Round (SUM(amount), 4) FROM table_name\n",
    "      (‘4’ meaning is  numbers after the comma)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Group by:\n",
    "    The ‘Group by’ clause divides the rows returned from the Select statement into groups. For each group, you can apply an aggregate function. For example;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Calculating the sum of items\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Count the number of items in the groups\n",
    "    ➽ SELECT column_1, aggregate_function(column_2)\n",
    "         FROM table_name\n",
    "         GROUP BY column_1;\n",
    "\n",
    "    We grouped the total amount by customer_id: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    ➽ SELECT customer_id, SUM(Amount)\n",
    "         FROM payment\n",
    "         GROUP BY customer_id;\n",
    "         \n",
    "    You have to write all columns to ‘Group by’ that are written to ‘Select’ statement. For example;\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ➽ SELECT customer_id, last_name, SUM(Amount)\n",
    "         FROM payment\n",
    "         GROUP BY customer_id, last_name;\n",
    "         \n",
    "    You can use numbers instead of column names. \n",

    "    ➽ SELECT customer_id, last_name, SUM(Amount)\n",
    "         FROM payment\n",
    "         GROUP BY 1,2; \n",
    "\n",
    "    Having:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    We often use the ‘Having’ clause in conjunction with the Group by clause to filter group rows that do not satisfy a specified condition. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    ➽ SELECT column_1, aggregate_function(column_2)\n",
    "         FROM payment\n",
    "         GROUP BY 1\n",
    "         HAVİNG condition;\n",
    "\n",
    "    The having clause sets the condition for group rows created by the Group by clause after the Group by clause applies while the where clause sets the condition for individual rows before Group by clause applies. This is the main difference between the Having and Where clauses.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ➽ SELECT customer_id, SUM(Amount)\n",
    "         FROM payment\n",
    "         GROUP BY customer_id\n",
    "         HAVİNG SUM(Amount) > 200 ;\n",
    "\n",
    "## __3- Joins__ \n",
    "\n",
    "    As statement:\n",
    "    AS allows us to rename columns or table selections with an alias. \n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "    Join types (inner, left, right, outer joins):\n",

    "\n",
    "    Er Diagram\n",
    "    To get data from both table, you use the “inner join” clause in the Select statement as follows:\n",

    "    ➽ SELECT A.pka,A.c1, B.pkb, B.c2\n",
    "         FROM A\n",

    "    First, You specify the column in both tables from which you want to select data in the Select clause.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Second, you specify the main table i.e, A in the From clause. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Third, you specify the table that the main table joins to i.e.,B in the Inner join clause. In addition, you put a join condition after the On keyword i.e., A:pka_Bfka.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The Inner join clause returns rows in A table that have the corresponding rows in the B table. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The Left join produces a complete set of records from Table A, with the matching records (where available) in Table B. ıf there is no match, the right side will contain null. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The Right join produces a complete set of records from Table B, with the matching records (where available) in Table A. ıf there is no match, the right side will contain null. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Union: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The ‘Union’ operator combines result sets of two or more Select statements into a single result set. The following illustrates the syntax of the Union operator that combines result sets from two queries: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    ➽ SELECT column_1, column_2\n",
    "         FROM table_name_1\n",
    "         UNION\n",
    "         SELECT column_1, column_2\n",
    "         FROM table_name_2\n",
    "         \n",
    "    The following are rules applied to the queries: \n",
    "    Both queries must return the same number of columns.\n",
    "    The corresponding columns in the queries must have compatible data types. \n",
    "    The union operator removes all duplicate rows unless the UNION ALL is used. \n",
    "    The union operator may place the rows in the first query bedore, after or between the rows in the result set of the second query. \n",
    "    To sort the rows in the combined result set by a specified column, you use the Order by clause. \n",

    "    Data types:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    PostgreSQL supports the following data types: \n",
    "    Boolean, can hold one of two possible values: true or false. In case the value is unknown the Null value is used. \n",
    "    Character, \n",
    "    *A single character: char\n",
    "    *Fixed-lenght character strings: char(n). If you insert a string that is shorter than the length of column, postgreSQL will pad spaces. If you insert a string that is longer than the length of the column, PostgreSQL will issue an error. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    *Variable-lenght character strings: varchar(n). You can store up to n characters with variable-length character strings. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Number, PostgreSQL provides two distinct types of numbers: integers and floating-point numbers. \n",
    "    *Small integer(smallint) is 2-byte signed integer that has a range of (-32768,32767)\n",
    "    *Integer (int) is 4-byte integer that has a range of (-214783648,214783647)\n",
    "    *Serial is the same as integer except that PostgreSQL populate value into column automatically. \n",
    "    *Float(n) is a floating-point number whose precision, at least, n, up to a max of 8 bytes. \n",
    "    *Real or float8 is a double-precision(8-byte) floating-point number. \n",
    "    *Numeric or numeric(p,s) is a real number with p digits with s number after the decimal point. *The numeric(p,) is the exact number. \n",
    "    Temporal i.e.,date and time related data types. \n",
    "    *Date stores date data\n",
    "    *Time stores time data\n",
    "    *Timestamp stores the data \n",
    "    *Interval stores the difference in timestamps\n",

    "    \n",
    "    Primary key and foreing key:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A primary key is a column or a group of columns that is used to identify a row uniquely in table. A table can have one and only one primary key. It is good practice to add a primary key to every table. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Normally we add the primary key to a table when we define the table’s structure using “Create Table” statement. \n",

    "    \n",
    "    A check constraint is a kind of constraint that allows you to specify if a value in a column must meet a specific requirement. \n",

    "    \n",
    "    In database theory, NULL is unknown or missing information. The NULL value is different from empty or zero. PostgreSQL provides the not-null constraint to enforce a column must not accept NULL values. It means that whenever you insert or update data, you must specify a value that is different from the NULL value.\n",

    "    “Unique” constraint:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Sometimes, you want to ensure that the value in a column or group of columns is unique across the whole table such as email address, username, employee id, etc. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    PostgreSQL provides you with a unique constraint to make that the uniqueness of the data is maintained correctly. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    With unique constraint, every time you insert a new row, PostgreSQL checks if the value is already in the table. If it found that the new value is already there, it would give back an error message and reject the changes. \n",

    "    A view is a database object that is of a stored query. A view can be accessible as a virtual table in PostgreSQL. In other words, a PostgreSQL view is a logical table that represents data one or more underlying tables through a Select statement.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A view helps simplify the complexity of a query because you can query a view, which is based on a complex query, using a simple Select statement.  Like a table, you can grant permission to users through a view that contains specific data that the users are authorized to see.\n",
